A toy JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Just for learning purpose.

## About

### About the project

This toy is created during my summer vacation. I began to be interested in JVM when I am working on JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation) and I am curious about its architecture and implementation.

### About the name

We all know that Java is named after "Java Coffee", which is also a small Indonesian island. As a tropical island, it produces not only coffee but also coconuts in abundance. And that is why I choose the name "coconut" for this JVM.
